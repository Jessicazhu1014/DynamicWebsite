            <p>The inspiration for this project came from my own cooking experiences. I only got into cooking when I came to school abroad, and I was overwhelmed when I first started learning how to cook. As I slowly practiced and grew, I was able to successfully reproduce most of the dishes I wanted to eat. So my goal in making this game is to get people interested in cooking through this game, so that they can discover a survival skill!</p>
