            <p>My relationship with the kitchen was so shallow that I didn’t even really know much about it until last year. My real connection to the kitchen came the day I started my college life, after I realized the reality that I was going to start my own life. At first I was afraid of cooking and even felt that cooking was a hassle because it would lead to all kinds of problems such as cleaning. But when all was said and done, only I knew that although I didn’t like cooking very much, I was a total food lover, so eventually my love for food overcame my laziness and I started to get busy in the kitchen cooking all kinds of dishes that I liked.</p>
